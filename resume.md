Integrated OpenAI API to automate data extraction from tender documents, reducing manual entry time by ~30%.
Streamlined CRM workflows by implementing Freshworks integration, centralizing customer communication.

Sendback – Web App Developer (Full Stack)						         April 2024 – August 2025
Built and maintained a full product analytics pipeline powering 10,000+ user return-tracking events using FastAPI, PostgreSQL, DynamoDB, and AWS S3.
Designed event-tracking schema (login, return submission, error states) enabling analysis of user flows, drop-off points, and repeat usage patterns.
Improved user authentication success rate by 24% by analyzing funnel metrics (OTP, Google OAuth, password resets) and optimizing flows based on weekly cohort review.
Integrated Amazon order-sync APIs; created metrics dashboards for product tracking speed, data sync failures, and customer satisfaction, reducing sync errors by 35%.
Built A/B test framework for UI updates in React; measured changes in return-completion rates and session length.
